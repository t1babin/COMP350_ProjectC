1). We, (Isaiah, Tim, and Tom) managed to complete all the steps and did exactly what they told us to do
2). To verify that everything works, run the simulator with this code here and Enter after the SHELL> prompt, either "type messag", "exec tstpr1", "exec tstpr2".
3). type messag: This should print out a message along the lines of "Read Line is working!", which varies between our 3 codes, and then return the user to the SHELL> prompt.
    exec tstpr1: This should print out a message that says "tstpr1 is working!", and then enter an infinite loop that hangs up the program.
    exec tstpr2: This should print out a message that says "tstpr2 is working!", and then return the user to the SHELL> prompt.
